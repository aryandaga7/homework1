Q2. What is a remote repository?

Ans: A remote repository refers to a Git repository that is hosted on another machine, server, or in a centralized place accessible to multiple users. It is commonly used to collaborate with others, allowing multiple developers to push or fetch data to and from it, ensuring a central source of truth for the project. Sites like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting for remote repositories, enabling teams to collaborate on a project, track issues, and manage changes from different contributors in an organized manner. Essentially, while your local repository is on your own computer, the remote repository acts as a shared space for all collaborators.
